               the incredibly talented Drake was born as Aubrey Drake Graham on October 24, 1986, in Toronto, Canada.
               Drake grew up with music in his blood. However,Drake's parents divorced when he was five years old and he was raised by his mother in Forest Hill. 
               Which is an affluent and predominantly Jewish neighborhood in Toronto.

                     As of this year Drake is now 32 years old and has put out another great
                 album called Scorpion. Although, in total majority of the songs are a hit but,
                 a few well known songs featured on there are called "In My Feelings....KiKi, do you love me?", "Mob Ties", and "Nonstop".
                 Also, he has been featured on other Good songs like collabing with Travis Scott's Sicko Mode,
                 Lil Baby's Yes Indeed and recently Meek Mill's Going Bad. He is always working before you know it 
                 he will probably have song hitting in summer 2019 too!!
